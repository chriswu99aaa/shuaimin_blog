## Amazon Web Service

> Pay what you used.

Client: a browser or  a desktop
Server: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

# Module 1

### Cloud Computing

> Cloud Computing: The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

* on demand delivery: use the service when you need without prior notice
* pay as you go pricing: pay only for the services you used

**AWS does the repetitive works such setting up database engines and other common work for you, and you focus on the work that distinguish you among the other**

### Deployment Models for Cloud Computing

* Cloud-Based Deployment: Design and develop the application completely on the cloud
* On-Premises Deployment: Resources are deployed on-premises
* Hybrid Deployment: Connect cloud based resources to on-premises infrastrucures, which means use both model together.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

* No cost for setting up data centres
* No cost for maintaining and data centres
* Use the capacity you need and pay as you go
* Lower price benefied from the Economy of Scales


# Module 2

## Compute in the Cloud

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2): provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.

Amazon EC2 consists of three stages

* Launch: Choose the EC2 instance that you want
* Connect:
* Use


### Lauch

* General Purpose Instance: A good balance between compute, memory, networking resources
* Compute Optimized Instance: Good for high performance web servers, compute intensive application servers
* Memory Optimized Instance: Good for senarios that require to preload large amount of data set into the memory
* Accelerated Computing Instance: Good for performing certain task faster than on CPU, such as floating point calculation, graphics application, application stream
* Storage Optimzied Instances: Good for work that require high read and write access to local storage. Examples: high-frequence online transaction system
