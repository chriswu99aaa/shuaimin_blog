## Week 1

### Aims of NLP Course

* Explain the fundamental principles and the major challenges in processing large-scale natural language text.
* Demonstrate how the essential components of NLP systems are built and tuned
* Introduce some principal appplications of NLP
    * information extraction
    * text classification
    * spoken language processing

Necessary steps for *understanding* a piece of data represented by a language

* text mining
* text analytics
* computational linguistics

### Natural Language System

A lanuage processing application requies the **use of knowledge about human language**

* information retrieval: searching document
* document classification: sorting documents into categories
* question answering: short answer for a question
* text summarisation: summarise a set of documents
* sentiment analysis: product reviews, hate cirme detection
* machien translation:
* natural language generation
* authoring and markin tools: check spelling, grammar, style

### Challenges of NLP

* unstructured data
* variability: many ways to express the same thing
* ambibuity: different meanings of words and sentences
    * lexical ambiguity: a word with multiple part of speech tags
    * lexical-semantic ambiguity: a word with different senses
    * syntactic ambiguity: ambiguity coming from possible word groupings.

### Basic Linguistic concepts

* parts of speech (POS)
    * open class words: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs
    * closed class words: pronouns, prepositions
* features/attributes
    * syntactic ambiguity

Syntactic ambiguity

* attachment ambiguity
* coordination ambiguity
* local ambiguity

### Corpus

a large collection of linguistic data

corpus can be 
* unannotated - raw text/speech
* annoated - enhanced with linguistic information

Annotaed (labelled) corpus: is a repository of explicit linguistic information

Annotation types
* grammatical
* semantic
* pragmatics
* combined

we need annotation for training and evaluation.
