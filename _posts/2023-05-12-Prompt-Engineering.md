## Key Prinicples

1. Write clear and explicit instructions
2. Give the model time to think

## Tactics

1. Use delimeters: ''', """
2. Ask for structured output. (HTML, JSON)
3. Check whether conditions are satisfied. Check assumptions required to do the task
4. Few-Shot prompting: give successful examples of completing tasks, then ask model to perform the task.
5. `Specify the steps to complete the task
6. Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

## Model Limitation

* Iterative process
  * try something
  * analyze where is the result does not give what you want
